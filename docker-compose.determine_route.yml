    # 1. Generate a waypoint path to optimise data collection
    # Takes in obstacle-map and base location and generates 
    # a list of waypoints to optimise search through obstacle 
    # signatures.


    #  /app/generate_search_route.py
    #     - obstacle map from kml
    #       - generate (+save)
    #     - generate grid
    #       - calculate obstacle signature from each point to base
    #       - for each 8-connected edge, make N subnodes
    #       - count unique signatures over each subnode
    #       - count unique signature over edge
    #       - plot points over obstacle xy colouring points based on data potential
    #       - now, we want to search the space to get as many unique collectibles
    #       - our context of signatures is not important now
    #       - orienteering problem (informative path planning)
    #       - we want to generate a path where nodes/edges give one-time rewards
    #       - so lets say thats implemented and wow it works
    #       - generate image of desired path over environment
    #       - generate image of expected obstacle signatures
    #       - generate image of expected obstacle signature set
