    # 1. Generate a waypoint path to optimise data collection
    # Takes in obstacle-map and base location and generates 
    # a list of waypoints to optimise search through obstacle 
    # signatures.
    #command: ["python3", "/app/generate_search_route.py"]

    # 2. Generate the signature associated dataset
    # Using the obstacle map and the rf data, generate the
    # polar graphs and contribute the provided rf data into
    # the provided association graph.
    #command: ["python3", "/app/extend_dataset.py"]

    # 3. Predict peer-to-peer comms
    # Using the association dataset and the new obstacle map
    # for the new location, run a live system which will display
    # the predicted dropoff graph between 2 points on an 
    # interactive display.
    #command: ["python3", "/app/predict_rf_dropoff.py"]



    # What functionality / visualising do they share?
    #  /app/generate_search_route.py
    #     - obstacle map from kml
    #       - generate (+save)
    #     - generate grid
    #       - calculate obstacle signature from each point to base
    #       - for each 8-connected edge, make N subnodes
    #       - count unique signatures over each subnode
    #       - count unique signature over edge
    #       - plot points over obstacle xy colouring points based on data potential
    #       - now, we want to search the space to get as many unique collectibles
    #       - our context of signatures is not important now
    #       - orienteering problem (informative path planning)
    #       - we want to generate a path where nodes/edges give one-time rewards
